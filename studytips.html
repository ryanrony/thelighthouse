  <h1>Study Tips</h1>

  <div class="tips-container">

    <div class="tip-card">
      <h2>⏱️ Pomodoro Technique</h2>
      <p>Study in focused 50-minute intervals followed by 10-minute breaks. Helps maintain attention and prevents burnout.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip-card">
      <h2>📒 Flashcards, Flashcards, Flashcards</h2>
      <p>Test yourself regularly instead of just rereading notes. Pulling information from memory strengthens retention and helps you remember for longer.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip-card">
      <h2>🔥 Blurting</h2>
      <p>Review material and then spend 30-40 minutes simply writing down as much as you can remember without looking at the content. Then go back and see what you missed out to find any weakpoints.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip-card">
      <h2>📊 Habit Tracking</h2>
      <p>Split tasks between priority and how much time they take, being organised will take you from a D student to an A* student.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip-card">
      <h2>📵 Phone away during focus period</h2>
      <p>Keep screen time as a reward after at least 2 hours of study. It will make learning seem less boring. (If you are using the pomodoro method, don't use your phone during the 10 minute break, it will be really hard to get back to learning otherwise)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip-card">
      <h2>👑 The most important tip</h2>
      <p>Start RIGHT NOW, keeping it for later is a huge mistake. Don't regret it.</p>
